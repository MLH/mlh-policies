# Disciplinary Action Policy
To ensure that Major League Hacking (MLH) sanctioned events are a safe and welcoming environment, MLH and the local event organizers reserve the right to refuse admittance to any individual to an event.  This document outlines common reasons that an individual could be refused entrance to an event, procedure for notifying the individuals and organizers of bans or suspensions, and outlines the appeals process.

In the event of a violation of sanctioning guidelines, Code of Conduct, or other official Major League Hacking regulation or policy, actions will be taken to rectify the issue. These actions will typically include, in order of severity, the following:

- Written or Verbal Warning outlining the violation and how the participant can take action to resolve the issue.
- Temporary Suspension from the current or future MLH season(s).
- Permanent Ban from all MLH activities.

Participants may attempt to appeal Temporary Suspensions and Permanent Bans by submitting a written request over email to incidents@mlh.io with “[Appeal]” in the subject line and attaching relevant evidence.  

## Notification Procedure

Participants who are issued a Temporary Suspension or Permanent Ban will be notified in writing via email. The email will include the following information:

- The exact cause for the Temporary Suspension or Permanent Ban.
- The length of the Suspension.  Bans are permanent.
- A link to this document and the document containing the violated policy.

If an individual attempts to register for a Sanctioned MLH Event which would take place during their Temporary Suspension or Permanent Ban, MLH will use the following procedure:

- The participant will be reminded in writing via email that they are not allowed to participate in the event.
- The local event organizers will be notified in writing via email that the individual is currently suspended or banned and should not be allowed to participate in the event.
- The on-site MLH representative will be notified in writing via email that the individual is currently suspended or banned and should not be allowed to participate in the event.

In the interest of privacy, MLH will not disclose the reason for the Temporary Suspension or Permanent Ban to the local event organizers unless it is at the individual's request to do so.

Major League Hacking reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part. If you have any questions regarding these policies, please contact MLH by e-mail at incidents@mlh.io.
