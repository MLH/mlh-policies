# Membership Guidelines

This document outlines the Major League Hacking (MLH) Membership Guidelines. MLH
provides all MLH Member Events with the following benefits and resources
(upon availability) to ease the lives of organizers and improve the hacker
experience. For more details, please go [here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-member-event-guidelines.pdf).

## Prerequisites

To be considered for membership your event must meet the following requirements
in addition to upholding the [Community Values](https://mlh.io/community-values).

1.  **Application Date.** To successfully support your hackathon, the event must
    start at least four (4) months in the future from the day that you submit
    your application. We ask that you apply this far in advance in order for
    events so that they have enough time to implement our guidance and achieve
    their fundraising and registration goals.

2.  **Event Date.** Your hackathon must take place during the current or
    upcoming academic year (August 31st, 2019 - June 30, 2020).

3.  **Free to attend.** Member Events do not have entry fees, which makes
    them open and accessible to all participants, regardless of their
    financial situations.

4.  **Primarily Students.** At least 80% of your hackathon’s attendees must
    be students at the time of the hackathon or have left school within
    the current academic year.

5.  **Level of Study.** Student attendees can be enrolled at any level of
    study at a traditional (middle school, high school, university,
    etc.) or nontraditional (code bootcamp, homeschool, online, etc.)
    institution.

6.  **Location.** We are only able to currently support Member Events located
    in the following regions:

    -   **North America:** United States, Canada, and Mexico.
    -   **Europe:** The United Kingdom, the European Union, and select other
        European countries.
    -   **Asia-Pacific:** India, Sri Lanka, and select countries in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Australasia.

7.  **Attendance.** We require Member Events to have a minimum number of
    attendees. To qualify to be a Member Event, you must be planning
    to have at least:

    -   **United States:** 150+ attendees
    -   **Other Countries:** 100+ attendees

8.  **Overnight Accommodations.** We require Member Events to leave their venues
    open overnight or provide alternate overnight accommodations for attendees,
    as many hackers travel long distances to attend hackathons.

9.  **Duration.** Member Events are 24 to 48 hours long and take place over
    a weekend (usually Friday to Sunday).

10. **Language.** We are only able to work with events that have an
    English-language website and make announcements during the event in English.
    If you live in a country where English is not the native language, we
    encourage you to make announcements and provide information in both languages.

## Benefits

We provide all Member Events with the following complementary benefits
and resources to ease the lives of organizers and improve the hacker
experience. We do not charge organizers or hackers a fee for these
benefits.

### Before your hackathon:

1.  **Dedicated Support & Mentorship.** Our team of Community Managers supports
    hundreds of Member Events every year. We've helped organizers like you
    handle all sorts of problems and questions. You may participate
    in [Peer Group](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/major-league-hacking-mlh-7841564385)
    hours to learn the team's expert advice and receive mentorship when you
    need it in a 1-on-1 environment.

2.  **Season Schedule Listing.** We’ll list your event on the official MLH
    Season schedule. Hundreds of thousands of hackers and sponsors visit
    this page every single year and use it to discover the events they want to
    participate in. We’ll also promote your event to hundreds of thousands of
    hackers and sponsors via social media and/or the MLH monthly newsletter.

3.  **Preferred Vendors & Discounts.** Organizing a great hackathon can be
    expensive. To help you save time and money, we have vetted and partnered
    with amazing vendors that are offering exclusive discounts and priority
    access to Member Events. Whether it's catering, stickers, or swag,
    we've got you covered!

4.  **Grants for First Time Member Events.** All first time Member Event
    hackathons are eligible for a one-time \$1,000 sponsorship and one sponsored
    ticket to MLH Hackcon from our friends at GitHub. All events are
    subject to approval from GitHub. Information will be sent out 40 days
    prior to your hackathon.

5.  **MLH Localhost Workshops.** Hackers want workshops. We’ve created a
    program called MLH Localhost to help you run high-quality workshops
    that get hackers excited either before the hackathon or teach your
    hackers something new during the event. All you need to do is find a
    volunteer to facilitate the workshop. We’ll take care of training
    them on the content and shipping supplies.

### During your hackathon:

1.  **On-site Support.** A representative from MLH will be on-site at your
    hackathon to help support you. Think of your MLH representatives as an
    extension of your organizing team. They have a lot of expertise and
    experience with organizing hackathons and are there to help make sure your
    event runs smoothly. They’re able to help you with anything you need,
    from making sure the event runs on-time to mentoring hackers to coordinating
    judging alongside you to even taking out the trash. They also have
    extensive experience resolving conflicts with hackers, sponsors,
    or even organizing teams.

2.  **Software Lab.** Every hacker who participates in an Member Event gets
    a bundle of promotional codes and discounts for services from the
    MLH Software Lab. This includes everything from web hosting credit
    to free domain names and beyond.

3.  **Hardware Lab.** The [MLH Hardware lab](http://hack.mlh.io/hardware)
    contains the latest and greatest hardware for hackers to loan out for
    free at all Member Events. We also built software and a process for events
    to keep track of which attendees have which devices. We are able to add
    non-MLH Hardware into our checkout system as requested. Lab contents
    vary by event.

    - **Asia-Pacific:** The hardware lab is currently not available to Member Events in Asia-Pacific.

4.  **MLH Emergency Budget.** On average, hackathons see about a 50% attrition
    rate between their signups during registration and the actual day-of
    check-ins. As a result, we encourage organizers to overbook for the
    hackathon up to 200% and have an emergency budget equal to the cost of
    one meal included in the total cost of the event. If the following two
    criteria listed below are satisfied on the day-of your event, then we'll
    cover the difference in food costs (up to \$1,000) to make sure your event
    doesn't go over budget: - More hackers show up than your target attendance
    on the day-of your event - You’ve exhausted all of your event’s money,
    including but not limited to emergency budget, total sponsorship raised,
    and savings, and purchasing extra food will cause your event finances to
    run into the negative and/or debt.

5.  **MyMLH Support.** Member Events who utilize [MyMLH](https://my.mlh.io/) 
    for registration will receive priority support for setup and
    troubleshooting from our engineering team. MyMLH is an OAuth API
    that makes registering for hackathons a breeze for hackers by
    storing their information and allowing them to easily share it with
    multiple events.

6.  **Mini-Events.** Our MLH representative on-site will run a 1 hour
    mini-event during your hackathon (before 9pm) to provide a fun break
    from hacking and create a bonding experience for your attendees.
    Previous Mini-Events include [Cup Stacking](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Resources/Cup-Stacking.html),
    [!Light](https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/no-light/),
    [Slideshare Karaoke](https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/slideshow-karaoke/),
    [Werewolf](http://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/) and more.

7.  **Season and Sponsor Swag.** Your event will receive assorted swag
    including Season shirts, Season stickers, event specific "I Demoed"
    stickers, MLH Stickers, GitHub stickers, and feminine hygiene
    products. Events may also receive assorted swag from MLH Season
    sponsors such as pens and t-shirts.

8.  **Judging Coordination.** We know that judging is one of the most
    stressful periods during a hackathon. Our MLH representative on-site
    can assist you with running demos and judging during your event in a
    fair, standardized way. You are still expected to recruit and
    coordinate the arrival of judges prior to the event.

9.  **Mentor Matcher.** We partnered up with our friends at Twilio and built
    the MLH Mentor Matcher to connect the hackers and mentors at your event.
    Hackers will have access to a custom phone number that they can text
    whenever they have a question with a description and their location.

10. **Prizes.** All Member Events are provided with special prizes to hand
    out to hackers such as medals for winners and [MLH category prizes](http://hack.mlh.io/prizes)
    (such as “Best Domain.com Domain Name” or “Best Use of Google Cloud
    Platform”). We will confirm these prizes with your event beforehand.

### After your hackathon:

1.  **Surveys.** Anyone who participates in your Member Event will receive a
    post event survey about their experience. We’ll share this data with
    you, show you how you compare to other Member Events, and identify
    some areas of improvement for your next event.

2.  **Scoring.** Hackers who participate in Member Events are earning points
    for their school in the MLH Season rankings. At the end of every
    Season, hackers can see how their schools performed against other
    schools and potentially win the MLH Season trophy to take back to
    their hacker club.

## Requirements

MLH was built by passionate community members. To ensure that Member
Events are as high quality as the hackathons we fell in love with,
organizers must meet the following requirements:

### Onboarding:

1.  **Read and sign the Member Event agreement.** All Member Event lead
    organizers are expected to read and sign the following documents to
    ensure that everyone is on the same page:

    a. **[Member Event Requirements & Benefits](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-member-event-guidelines.pdf)** - This
    document outlines the things that we need you to do before, during, and
    after your hackathon and the things we’re doing for you as well.

    b. **[Community Values](https://mlh.io/community-values)** - This document
    presents a set of principles shared by every Member Event that serve as
    examples of excellence to your attendees and sponsors, as well as other
    hackathons and communities. All Member Events are expected to uphold
    these Community Values.

    c. **[Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)** - This document contains the
    guidelines for expected behavior of all attendees (including volunteers,
    mentors, sponsors, organizers, judges, etc.) at MLH events. Having a single
    code of conduct that is used by every hackathon helps us ensure that MLH
    events are safe and inclusive spaces for everyone and that expectations for
    behavior and incident response remain consistent for people who attend
    multiple MLH events. As an organizer of a Member Event, you are expected to
    adopt, make publicly available, and enforce the MLH Code of Conduct.
    If an incident is reported, organizers must immediately involve the onsite
    MLH Representative or MLH Incidents Team who will work with you to follow
    our official [incident response procedure](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/master/incident-response.md).

2.  **Registration Form.** We require Member Events to update their
    registration form to include a set of basic fields and checkboxes.
    This ensures that we know who is attending Member Events and that
    attendees know what they are agreeing to. We do not collect,
    utilize, or share any personal information without an attendee
    opt-in.

    a. **Contact / Demographic Info.** Your registration form MUST ask for:
    first name, last name, email, school, and phone number. Optionally, we
    encourage you to also ask for: age, gender, race/ethnicity, major, current
    level of study, and expected graduation year.

    b. **MLH Code of Conduct, Data Sharing, and Terms & Conditions Checkbox.** Add a checkbox with the following
    language to your registration form: "I have read and agree to
    the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).
    I authorize you to share my application/registration information for event
    administration, ranking, MLH administration, pre- and post-event
    informational e-mails, and occasional messages about hackathons in-line
    with the [MLH Privacy Policy](https://mlh.io/privacy). I further agree to
    the terms of both the [MLH Contest Terms and Conditions](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/tree/master/prize-terms-and-conditions) and the [MLH Privacy Policy](https://mlh.io/privacy).”

    We have grouped these terms into a single checkbox for ease of setup and
    improved user experience. If your local laws require you to separate these
    terms (Ex. GDPR), you can find those [checkbox requirements here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7HSIEO8tA7vbD0dtwvesMOhDAea8nDKJlu3f3kS8pE/edit?usp=sharing).

3.  **MLH Website Branding.** On your hackathon’s website, you must display
    the MLH Season Trust Badge in the header and the MLH logo under your
    partners section. Hackers and sponsors see the presence of these
    logos and know that you have achieved the level of quality
    guaranteed by being a Member Event.  You can find these assets on
    our official [Brand Guidelines](https://mlh.io/brand-guidelines).

4.  **Brand License.** We will include your event on the official
    Season schedule and promote it to our community, but we need your
    permission to do so. By signing this agreement, you grant MLH an
    indefinite license to use your event name, branding, and materials
    to market your event and the Season of Member Events. Additionally,
    we grant Member Events a non-exclusive license to use the MLH name and
    brand in conjunction with the event. MLH reserves the right to
    terminate the organizer's license at any time at our absolute discretion.

5.  **Content Agreement.** We love posting photos and videos of Member
    Events on our website and social media, but we can’t do that without
    your permission. Grant MLH permission to record and publish photos
    and video of the event and the right to produce commercial
    video content (this does not include TV news or sponsor/event
    recaps).

6.  **Property Care Agreement.** Member Events recognize that any MLH
    property they borrow (hardware, signage, mini-event supplies, etc.)
    will be used by other Member Events during the year. If any supplies
    are lost, damaged, or late, other events will be unable to utilize
    them. You agree to see that, to the best of your ability, all MLH
    property is cared for and returned on time by your hackers,
    organizers, sponsors, and volunteers.

### Before your hackathon:

1.  **Event Details.** In order to send our staff and resources to your
    hackathon, we need you to submit the following information at least
    three (4) months before the event:
    a. Event start and end times
    b. Venue Address
    c. Package Shipping Address and point of contact (full name, email, address, and phone number)
    d. Loading Dock Address & Hours and point of contact (full name, email, address and phone number)

2)  **Pre-Event Call.** Attend a call with your MLH Community Manager about
    three (3) weeks before the event. We’ll use this time to review your
    final schedule, preview plans for demos and judging, and work
    through any other issues you are facing. We will also let you know
    who your MLH representative on site will be and what shipments
    and packages to expect from us.

3)  **Prize List.** Update your list of prizes to include any MLH categories
    (full list provided by your MLH Community Manager) and add "MLH
    Winner Pins" to the list of prizes that your top team’s receive.
    We partner with both [Devpost](https://devpost.com) and [Hacker Earth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) to make this
    easier. As a result, by becoming a Member Event, your hackathon page may
    automatically include MLH branding, prizes, and/or allow us direct
    access.

4)  **Registration Data.** Submit all registration data to your MLH
    Community Manager no later than one (1) week prior your event’s
    start date. We use this data to 1) ensure that no repeat violators
    of the Code of Conduct are attending the event and 2) send
    attendees a pre-event email with info about the resources MLH is
    bringing to the event for them to use and 3) send an email asking
    them to opt-in to the MLH newsletter for future info about hackathons
    and the League. . If there are Code of Conduct issues with any attendees
    prior to the event, we will contact you for resolution.

### During your hackathon:

1.  **Opening Ceremony.** Reserve 5 minutes for your MLH representative
    to speak (with slides) during opening ceremony and share any resources/swag
    available for your hackers to use during the hackathon.

2.  **Closing Ceremony.** Reserve 5 minutes during your closing
    ceremony for your MLH representative to make a few remarks on behalf
    of MLH and award prizes to the teams that won any MLH category
    prizes. As the overall winners of the event are announced, your MLH
    representative will help you distribute finalist pins to each of
    the teams and take photos of each winning team.

3.  **MLH Table.** Reserve a table (4x6 feet or 1.2x1.8 meters minimum)
    for your MLH representative to engage with attendees and distribute
    swag/credits (stickers, website domains, hosting credit, t-shirts, etc).

4.  **Hardware Lab Table.** Reserve a table (4x6 feet or 1.2x1.8 meters minimum)
    in a central place for the MLH Hardware Lab to operate. You will
    be expected to find and assign volunteers by time-shifts to manage
    the MLH Hardware Lab for the full duration of the event. By
    providing volunteers, our MLH rep will be freed up to help your
    organizing team and hackers with higher priority event support.

    - **Asia-Pacific:** Reservation of a table for the MLH Hardware Lab is not required.

5.  **Signage.** Display MLH Season and directional signage in key areas
    during the event. Much like displaying the Trust Badge on your
    website, having MLH signage on-site during the event signals your
    commitment to hosting a high quality event and makes your attendees
    feel like they are part of a larger movement.

6.  **Check-in.** Allow your MLH representative to distribute MLH swag and
    promotional items at the attendee checkin area. Hackers love to
    receive swag and goodies. Distributing these at checkin creates a
    great first impression and ensures that everyone gets some.

7.  **Mini-Event.** Reserve a 1-hour block in your schedule (before 10pm)
    for your MLH representative to run a fun mini-event for attendees.
    Mini-events are a great way for participants to take a break and
    network with each other.

### After your hackathon:

1.  **Checkin & Submission Data.** Submit all checkin and submissions data
    to your MLH Community Manager no later than one week after your
    event. We use this data to calculate Season rankings and to send
    attendees a post event survey to collect their
    feedback.

2.  **Post-Event Call.** Attend a call with your assigned MLH Community
    Manager about three weeks after the event. We’ll use this time to
    run a short retrospective on working together, provide feedback, and
    start planning for future events!
