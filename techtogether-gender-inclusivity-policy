##TechTogether Gender Inclusivity Policy

TechTogether events aim to address the gender inequities in the hackathon community and serve people of marginalized gender identities, this includes transgender women, cisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, and all gender identities which have been systematically oppressed by those in power throughout history. TechTogether hackathons are only open to people with these identities.

In registration and checkin flows TechTogether events may ask specific questions to determine a participant’s eligibility in the event. After participants answer these questions, TechTogether Organizers will make no further effort to investigate a participant’s gender identity or expression for the purpose of eligibility at the event.

TechTogether welcomes mentors, judges, sponsors, and other supporters of all genders.
